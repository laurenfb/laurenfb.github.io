    <h2>Ada Week 7 recap</h2>

      We didn't have class in week 7, but that didn't mean we didn't have work to do! There were two big projects for our break week, one of which was this site. Quickly, I found that HTML and CSS were much easier when I was able to design the wireframes myself. Even though I don't really enjoy the design process, I'm proud of where this site ended up.

      We also made a simple Ruby class for a door that might be found in an adventure video game. Each instance of the door object needed to be lockable and openable. It was a fun assignment, especially since I got to go back to Ruby after a week of front-end. Jumping back in was smooth, and this time around writing tests came naturally.

      The last thing I'll note about this week was that each new concept we learn seems to be incredibly difficult when we start it. But after about a week of working with the subject, it suddenly becomes much easier -- there's almost a tipping point where it clicks. This was really reassuring after the rough week of CSS, and a good lesson to take forward.
