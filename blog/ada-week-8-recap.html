    <h2>Ada Week 8 recap</h2>

      Our first week of Rails. The instructors asked us not to do any research or tutorials on Rails over our break week, for a very interesting reason. There's a lot of "Rails Magic" that goes on behind the scenes, and they wanted to start from the very beginning so we'd know what and why things happen.

      Most of the week was spent "live coding," where the entire class works along on their machine while the instructor broadcasts their screen on AirPlay. I really enjoy this type of lecture-plus-work-time combination. It feels like I learn the most in these sessions.

      Despite an overwhelming start to the week, with a whole lot of new information to pack into our heads, I felt confident by the time our main project began on Wednesday. We created a to-do web app for listing and keeping track of tasks. I was really happy with where mine ended up!
