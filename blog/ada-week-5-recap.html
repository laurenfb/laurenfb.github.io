  <h2>Ada Week 5 recap</h2>
  <h4>

  <p>
    Week 5 was the best one yet. The Farmer's Market Finder, aka FarMar, was our mini-capstone project for Ruby. Using CSVs with thousands of lines of data about markets, vendors, products, and sales, we were tasked with creating a back end for an application to store and search for information.

    The project was individual, and working alone was very rewarding. Again, the group that sits around me was very generous with help and time for each other. Checking each small method off of a long list of requirements was enjoyable to me, and by the end of the week I had a product I was very proud of. My tests were rigorous and I had 100% coverage, which felt great after struggling so mightily the previous week with the very concept of TDD.

    Throughout my time in Ada, I've been very focused on keeping my eyes on my own paper, so to speak. This week was the first where I felt like I really succeeded in this. It didn't matter to me whether a classmate seemed to be ahead of me or behind me as we worked. I had real confidence that I could finish the project, and it didn't matter as much this time whether my friends and classmates got there first.
