      Week 1, also known as "what have we gotten ourselves into?!" The first day began with a breakfast potluck, which is a little terrifying. I held a ceramic dish full of homemade muffins as I stood and swayed on the bus, trying not to panic on the inside.

      The first Ada cohort to have two classes at once, we were divided early on into Brackets and Parens, then introduced to our instructors. Along with 23 others, I'm a Paren.

      The majority of the week was spent on Ruby Fundamentals. We covered the Jumpstart curriculum in under a week, which is amazing to me considering my first education in programming was an 8-week class that taught less than Jumpstart.
