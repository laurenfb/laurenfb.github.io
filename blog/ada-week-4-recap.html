    <h2>Ada Week 4 recap</h2>
    <h4>

    <p>
      We learned a lot in week 4, but not without struggle. This was our first week practicing Test-Driven Development full-time, and it was our first time working very closely with a partner. Our project this week was the back end of a Scrabble game, including appropriate scoring for words, the ability to store player information, and keep track of which tiles have been played.

      My partner and I worked well together, but we did come up against some challenges. In the end, our program met MVP, and by Friday afternoon we were too wiped out to take on the optional challenges. Next time I hope we can take the next step.
