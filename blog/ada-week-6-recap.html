    <h2>Ada Week 6 recap</h2>

    <p>
      Week 6 was a tough one for all but a lucky few at Ada. After <a href='ada-week-5-recap.html'>FarMar</a> we were officially intermediate Rubyists. It was time to start with the front end, which meant HTML and CSS.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shifting our brains from Ruby was tough. Gone were the detailed and helpful error messages Ruby hands over. Goodbye, truth tables; hello, HTML5 tags that did not exist last time I made a website from scratch (that would be the 90s).
    </p>

    <p>
      Some Parens found the immediate visual feedback offered by front end languages, CSS especially, to be exciting and rewarding. Others of us struggled to transition our thinking from the logic and structure of the back end to the layout and detail of the front end. By the end of the week, we were all ready to give up, until Jeremy gave a touching lecture on his final day as an Ada instructor. It wasn't recorded, so you'll just have to believe me when I say that it cheered us all up.
