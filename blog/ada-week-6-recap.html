    <h2>Ada Week 6 recap</h2>
    <h4>

    <p>
      Week 6 was a tough one for all but a lucky few at Ada. After completing the <a href='ada-week-5-recap.html'>previous week's</a> FarMar project, we'd officially finished with intermediate Ruby. It was time to learn a bit more about the front end, so this week was entirely focused on HTML and CSS.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shifting our brains from Ruby involved a lot of work. Gone were the detailed and helpful error messages Ruby hands over, replaced by new, somewhat opaque concepts like "inline-block." Goodbye to truth tables (my favorite thing, no joke). Hello to a whole bunch of new HTML tags that did not exist last time I made a website from scratch (that would be the 90s?).

      Some folks found the immediate visual feedback offered by front end languages, CSS especially, to be exciting and useful. Others of us struggled to transition our thinking from the logic and structure of the back end to the layout and deail of the front end. By the end of the week, we were all ready to give up, until Jeremy gave a touching lecture on his final day as an Ada instructor. It wasn't recorded, so you'll just have to believe me when I say that it cheered us all up and made us not hate CSS quite so much.
